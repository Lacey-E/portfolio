        <p>
            Object are used in the real world to represent entities. OOP means Object oriented programming. <br>
            <br>
            To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces.
            The following example creates an empty object that is assigned to the variable spiderman: <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;const spiderman = {}; <br>
            <br>
            You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation <br>
            <br>

            &emsp;superman.name <br>
            &emsp;'Superman'<br>
            <br>
            <b>OR use the brackets</b> <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;superman["real" + " " + "name"] <em>// the property is built using string concatenation</em> <br>
            &emsp; "Clark Kent" <br>
            <br>
        </p>


        <h3>
            This In Js:
        </h3>
        <p>
            To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.

            The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.
            <br>
            This when called in the instance of an object, then this becomes the instance <br>

            <br>
            &emsp; function Human (age) { <br>
            &emsp; this.age = age <br>
            &emsp; } <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;let greg = new Human(22) <br>
            &emsp;let thomas = new Human(24) <br>

            &emsp;console.log(greg) // this.age = 22 <br>
            &emsp;console.log(thomas) // this.age = 24 <br>
        </p>



        <h3>
            Summary:
        </h3>
        <p>
            *Copied from the Notes <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
                <li> Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().</li>
                <li>Methods can reference the object as this.</li>
                <li>The value of this is defined at run-time.</li>

                <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is
                    called.</li>
                <li>A function can be copied between objects.
                <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call
                    is object.</li>
                <li>Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an
                    arrow function, it is taken from outside.</li>

            </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>
            Document Object Module{DOM}:
        </h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; To my understanding the DOM connects HTML and JS. It allows everything
            within a webpage to treated as nodes including html tags and atributes. <br>

            <br> <em>The DOM is not actually part of JavaScript because it is language agnostic</em> <br>
            but it is the most associated and used language with it.
        </p>

        <h3>Events Listners</h3>

            Basically events listners, listens for when events actually happen.
