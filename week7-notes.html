<h3>Further Functions</h3>
<p>
    First class Object: they have properties and methods themselves. 
<br>
&emsp; The call() is used to set the value of "this" inside a Functions
to an object that is provided as the first argument.
    <br>

   <br>
   &emsp; &emsp;function sayHello(){  <br>
   <br>    &emsp; &emsp; return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`; <br>
    } <br>

    <br>

    &emsp; const clark = { name: 'Clark' }; <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };<br>

    &emsp;sayHello.call(clark);<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;<< 'Hello, my name is Clarke'<br>

    &emsp;&emsp;sayHello.call(bruce);<br>
    &emsp;<< 'Hello, my name is Bruce'<br>
    <br>
    <br>

If there is a parameter to be called along with the call it needs to be specified. example: <br>

<br>
&emsp;&emsp;function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){<br>
    ;&emsp;return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;<br>
    &emsp; }<br>

    &emsp;sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');<br>
    &emsp;<< 'How do you do, my name is Clark'<br>

    &emsp;sayHello.call(bruce);<br>
    &emsp;<< 'Hello, my name is Bruce' <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    If a function doesnâ€™t refer to an object as this in its body, 
    it can still be called using the call() method, but you need provide 
    null as its first argument.
     For example, we could call the square() function using the call() method, like so:
     <br>
     <br>
     square.call(null, 4)<br>
<< 16<br>
</p>

<h3>
    Immediately Invoke Function Expressions (IIFE)
</h3>
<p>
An annoynymos function that is invoked as soon as it is defined, 
achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
<br>
<br>
(function(){ <br>
    const temp = 'World';<br>
    console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br>
    })();<br>
    << 'Hello World'<br>

    <br>
    it can be used for safe use of "Strict Mode" simply write all your codes within an IIFE
</p>

<h3>
    Ajax
</h3>
<p>
    Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response 
    to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.
</p>

        <br>
<p>
    The Fetch API provides a global fetch() method that only has 
    one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource 
    you wish to fetch. 
    A very basic example would look something like the 
    following piece of code: <br> <br>

    &emsp;fetch('https://example.com/data') <br>
    &emsp;.then( // code that handles the response ) <br>
    &emsp;.catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error ) <br>
<br>
Use an if block to check if the request was successful, and throw an error otherwise:
<br>
const url = 'https:example.com/data';<br>

fetch(url) <br>
.then((response) => { <br>
    if(response.ok) { <br>
        return response; <br>
    } <br>
    throw Error(response.statusText); <br>
}) <br>
.then( response => // do something with response ) <br>
.catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') ) <br>
<br>

The five most commonly used verbs when dealing with resources on the web are: <br>

GET requests to retrieve resources <br>

POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task <br>

PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely <br>

PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource <br>

DELETE requests to delete a resources. <br>
